## Code

Lishogi is [Lichess](https://lichess.org) rewritten for shogi.
Lishogi is written in [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org/),
and relies on the [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) framework.
[scalatags](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/scalatags/) is used for templating.
Pure shogi logic is contained in the [shogi](modules/shogi) submodule.
The server is fully asynchronous, making heavy use of Scala Futures and [Akka streams](http://akka.io).
WebSocket connections are handled by a [separate server](https://github.com/WandererXII/lila-ws) that communicates using [redis](https://redis.io/).
It uses [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) to store games.
HTTP requests and WebSocket connections can be proxied by [nginx](http://nginx.org).
The web client is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom), using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to generate CSS.
The [blog](https://lishogi.org/blog) uses a free open content plan from [prismic.io](https://prismic.io).

Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/WandererXII/lishogi/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.
